{% highlight coq %}

Definition topping :  Prop :=

{% endhighlight %}

* 150g sugar
* 1 cup of chocolate powder (i.e. Ovaltine [my fav], Nesquik) or cocoa powder if you prefer less sugary treats
* 3 tsbp butter
* 50ml milk (2% or 3%)




### Preparation

Preheat your oven to 180C.

#### Dough

Add the diced carrots, eggs, (optional) egg white and sugar to the blender.
Mix it until you obtain a uniform manifold. That usually takes 2-3 min.

_Warning_: If your blender is old, or if it's one of those small unverified nutribullets, do not add the sugar. Keep the sugar for the next step.

In a large bowl, pour the mix, sieve the flour and add a pinch of salt. If you did not add the sugar previously, do it now.
Using a mixer, mix everything until you obtain a homogeneous mix.

Lastly, add the baking powder and give it a final mix.

In a non-stick cake tin (mine has 21cm x 28cm), pour the mix and take it to the oven until the top is golden.
It normally takes 45min.

Once it's baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool down completely.

Pour all your frustration of universe polymorphism into the cake by creating several holes in its surface with a fork.

#### Topping

This cake receives a verified tasty chocolate topping.

In a sauce pan, add the butter, sugar, chocolate/cocoa powder and the milk.
Using medium heat, mix all the ingredients. Do not stop the motion, otherwise the topping won't be smooth.
Mix it until you start seeing some heat bubbles on the sides or middle of the pan. Once they show up, count 1 minute, keep mixing, then turn off the heat. 

Quickly pour the topping over the cake.

Let it cool down and enjoy the distinguished dish award.


### Useful hints

You should know this by then, but you can verify the readiness of the cake by inserting a fork in the middle and observing if the fork comes out clean. If it does, the cake is probably ready.


### Appendix, Theorems and Artifact


This cake is consumed for breakfast in South America. 
If you want a healthier version of it, do not add the chocolate topping. 
Sadder but healthier.

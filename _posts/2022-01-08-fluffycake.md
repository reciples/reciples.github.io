{% endhighlight %}


* 2 Large Eggs
* 300 g sugar
* 111 g Milk Powder (Whole milk)
* 385 g white flour
* 250 ml water
* 200 ml oil (olive oil \/ sunflower oil \/ other vegetable oil)
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* Salt
* (optional) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

{% highlight coq %}

Definition cake_topping :  Prop :=

{% endhighlight %}

* 1 can condensed milk (approx 260 g); 2 if you like very sweet desserts
* 1 tbsp butter (2 if you go for 2 condensed milk cans)
* 3 tbsp Milk Powder (Whole milk) (4 if you go for 2 condensed milk cans)
* 100 ml heavy cream (35%) (160 ml if you go for 2 condensed milk cans)

You'll need a mixer.



### Preparation

Preheat your oven to 180C (or 350F) while you prepare the cake dough.

In a large bowl, add the eggs and the sugar. Using a mixer, mix everything for about 4 minutes until it becomes a white, homogeneous mix. This step is very important, it is the baseline for fluffiness preservation!

Add the milk powder (111 g) in the bowl, then sieve the flour, add it to the bowl. Add water, then add the oil. Add a tiny pinch of salt, and the Optional Vanilla. 
*Using a whisk*, slowly mix all the ingredients. Be gentle! You want to preserve the fluffiness from the initial proof!

Lastly, add the baking powder, give it a last gentle mix. You'll notice the cake dough feels heavy, and you might think "this is not provable". It is! That is how it should be.

Spray oil or use parchment paper in a 20cm x 30cm (approx) baking pan. Drop your heavy cake dough in it; spread it gently. Put in the oven for 40 minutes, or until it's totally baked. *Avoid* opening the oven before 35 min. 

While the fluffy artifact bakes, focus on the topping. In a pan, add the condensed milk, butter and milk powder. Medium head until the butter melts and everything becomes a homogeneous mix. Put it on the minimum heat you can get; add half of the heavy cream; mix it gently. Turn off the heat; add the remaining portion of the heavy cream; give it a last gentle mix.

When the cake is fully baked, create multiple holes in it using a fork; `eapply` the topping. Let it cool down for about 30-40 minutes.

Enjoy!



### Useful hints

\[ 1 \] You can put the fluffy cake in the fridge for one hour. It'll absorb the moisture of the topping, and it will become dense. It still preserves the original fluffynes.

\[ 2 \] DO NOT eat this cake when it's warm. Specially if you are lactose intolerant. Type safety is not guaranteed in high temperatures.
